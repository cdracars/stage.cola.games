      <p>
        Live-action roleplaying (or LARP, as itâ€™s commonly called) is very
        similar to a tabletop roleplaying game like Dungeons and Dragons.
        Players generate and portray a character, interacting and making
        decisions for that character. Another player (often called a GM or
        Storyteller) describes the game world, filling it with interesting
        characters, stories, and challenges for player characters to overcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key difference with live-action is, rather than sitting around a
        table with your friends describing what your character does and how they
        act, you move around and interact with your friends and the environment
        as if you were your character!
